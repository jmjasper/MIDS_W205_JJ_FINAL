###Setup

Two new components that will need to be installed are the NLTK python package and the vaderSentiment package.

These can be installed with pip install nltk and pip install vaderSentiment.

However, once installed, you need to downloard the dictionaries for nltk. You can do this by opening an interpreted python session with python.

Once in the session, import the library with: import nltk.

Then access the downloader with nltk.download(). This will bring up a bunch of options. You can download the entire corpus with d all.

This still will take a bit.
